Assignment Project
So basically, the website I have created is for students who wants to go to University and for parents who want to know more about universities and make good decisions for their students.

Hence, I created an University website called Stanford University which allows students and parents to navigate through that university and be able to know the different courses, the university offers. Also, parents can contact the university office through their office phone number if they have any questions and enquiries about the university. Then, there are good feedbacks in the university website that will help entice students to join that university as the university have good lecturers and will go all the way to help students and prepare them for the workforce. Lastly, the students can know about the university and the lecturers there and how high the graduation rate is so that the students can apply Stanford University and find an IT job easily from there.
